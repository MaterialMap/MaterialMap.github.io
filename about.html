                    This website and project are non-commercial and ad-free. The
                    primary goal is to assist engineers in finding examples of
                    material model parameter sets for LS-DYNA, sourced from
                    articles published under Open Access. Accordingly, this site
                    does not store any data and always provides links to
                    original open-access sources, along with citation
                    information for each reference.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The website is a static site built from the
                    <a href="https://github.com/yurynovozhilov/MaterialMap"
                        >MaterialMap GitHub repository</a
                    >, and anyone is welcome to contribute by adding a new
                    article with LS-DYNA material models to the site’s library
                    or correcting errors through GitHub Issues or by editing the
                    site's files. Currently, the entire site’s database is
                    stored in multipes <code>YAML</code> files in 
                    <a href="https://github.com/yurynovozhilov/MaterialMap/tree/main/data">data</a> repository directory.
