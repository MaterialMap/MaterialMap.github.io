# Material MAP

This repository supports the **Material MAP** website, a non-commercial, ad-free project aimed at assisting engineers in finding examples of material model parameter sets for LS-DYNA, sourced from articles published under Open Access. 

The primary goal of the website is to provide engineers with a library of material models, linking directly to original open-access sources along with citation information for each reference. The project enables users to search and explore a variety of material models conveniently.

## About the Project

Material MAP is a static website, built to offer a reference library for material models used in LS-DYNA simulations. All site data is stored in a multiple `yaml` files form `data` directory, allowing easy updates and additions. Users are welcome to contribute by submitting new references with material models or correcting existing data.

### Key Features

- **Non-commercial**: The site is entirely ad-free and provides its content for informational purposes only.
- **Open-access links**: All data references point to open-access sources, ensuring users can access original articles freely.
- **Citation Information**: Each reference includes proper citation details to give credit to the original authors.
- **User Contribution**: Contributions are encouraged, allowing users to add new material models or improve data accuracy.
